#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?  
Computer science is a term with a very broad-scope. It encompasses almost every facet of software development â€“ ranging from testing, development, and designing software systems. Computer scientists are important for many reasons. Sufficed to say, they are important because almost everything we do in life today involves using software applications. Computer scientists solve problems by developing software that interacts with systems and people to accomplish goals. This exemplified more than ever right now as society is being shaped by Artificial Intelligence. Computer scientists design the technology, algorithms, and implementations of AI in our daily lives. So, in effect, Computer Science has a major impact on society!  
  
#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
We have studied various software development models throughout the courses at SNHU. They all have their advantages and disadvantages, and are used based on the needs of the organization and how they feel best to meet their needs. I used an Agile-based approach for completing this project. I feel this approach worked very well because I could work on the technologies and functionalities incrementally. Furthermore, I could test functionality in each iteration before moving on to the next one.  
  
Something that this course has highlighted, is that there are clearly many ways to solve technology problems. We started learning basic machine learning techniques with neural networks, then convolutional neural networks, then reinforced learning and deep Q-learning. These are the fundamental building blocks of how artificial intelligence is implemented throughout the world right now. Armed with the knowledge we have gained in this class, we now have more tools available us to approach and solve problems.  
  
#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?  
Update here to talk about GDPR, etc...
